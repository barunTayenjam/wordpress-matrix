```bash
# Create a new WordPress site (interactive)
./scripts/manage.sh create-site

# List all WordPress sites
./scripts/manage.sh list-sites

# Get information about a specific site
./scripts/manage.sh site-info myproject

# Advanced site management
./scripts/manage-sites.sh start myproject    # Start a site
./scripts/manage-sites.sh stop myproject     # Stop a site
./scripts/manage-sites.sh remove myproject   # Remove a site
```

### Site Creation Process
